# Recursion

### Welcome!
This GitHub repository is where you can work and submit your Act 3 Recursion.java activity!
```text
Note: Please read all the information below before starting the activity!
```

For detailed instructions, you can check the presentation here: [Recursion Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yfk42CqjIMAhe3XYSyLdoz0rXOzAKOmKbhXLNTC08d0/edit#slide=id.p).

Or you can keep reading!

## Activity Instructions

For your Recursion Manipulation activity, you need to:

```
Create a program called Recursion.java
Implement an iterative method named printReverseIter() that takes an int as a parameter and print the numbers as follows: n, n-1, n -2,..., 1
Write a recursive method named printReverseRec() that does the same as the last method.
Write an iterative method called getSum() that takes an int n as a parameter and calculates the sum of all the numbers between 1 and n.
Implement the recursive method for getSum().
Write a recursive method named printReverse()that will take a String as a parameter and will print it in reverse order.
Trace the diagram from the workbook.
```
*Note: Do everything in the same java file.*

### Expected Output
```
printReverseIter(): 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 
printReverseRec():
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Iterative-based getSum():
15
Recursive-based getSum():
15
printReverse():
retupmoC
```
