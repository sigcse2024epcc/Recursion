### Welcome!
Here you will be working and submitting your Activity 3!
`
Note: Please read all the information below before starting the activity!

For detailed instructions, you can check the presentation here: [Recursion Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yfk42CqjIMAhe3XYSyLdoz0rXOzAKOmKbhXLNTC08d0/edit#slide=id.p).
`
Note: You can copy the code to your VS Code and work from there (recommended), or you can directly work on GitHub Codespaces.

## Activity Instructions

For your Recursion activity, you need to:

```
* Create a program called Recursion.java
* Implement an iterative method named printReverseIter() that takes an int as a parameter and print the numbers as follows: n, n-1, n -2,..., 1
* Write a recursive method named printReverseRec() that does the same as the last method.
* Write an iterative method called getSum() that takes an int n as a parameter and calculates the sum of all the numbers between 1 and n.
* Implement the recursive method for getSum().
* Write a recursive method named printReverse()that will take a String as a parameter and will print it in reverse order.
```

### Expected Output
```
printReverseIter(): 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 
printReverseRec():
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Iterative-based getSum():
15
Recursive-based getSum():
15
printReverse():
retupmoC
```
